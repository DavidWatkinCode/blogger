Following the [Jumpstart Lab](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html) tutorial, I created a blog with commenting, tagging and authentication functionality. I may revisit in the future to polish up and use for personnal projects.
This was the project for Web Development 101 - Web Development Frameworks, part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com).
